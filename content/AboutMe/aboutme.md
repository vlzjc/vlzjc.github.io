# ðŸ‘‹ Jaime Here!

And yes, I did use my name as a greeting. */Hay.-meh/* :)

<span style="font-size: 28px;">I'm a data analyst who loves turning numbers into compelling narratives. I'm passionate about digging into data, uncovering insights, and visualizing them in ways that make a real impact. My Computer Science background and certifications in Google Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data Science provide a strong foundation for my analytical work.  Running a small manufacturing business has given me invaluable experience in leading teams and understanding the real-world impact of data-driven decisions. When I'm not working with data, I enjoy gaming â€“ I love the strategic thinking involved. Let's connect! Find me on LinkedIn (links in the sidebar).</span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;">My background in Computer Science gave me a solid tech foundation, which I've built on with certifications in Google Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data Science. I'm always eager to learn new tools and techniques to stay ahead of the curve.</span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;">I am currently running a small manufacturing business, which might seem like a detour, but it's been an incredible learning experience.  Leading a team, streamlining operations, and understanding the business side of things has given me a unique perspective on how data can drive real-world impact.  Plus, it generates tons of data â€“ a playground for any analyst!

<span style="font-size: 28px;">When I'm not wrestling with data (or spreadsheets), you'll probably find me gaming. I love the strategic thinking and data-driven decision-making that goes into even the most casual games.

Thanks for stopping by!
