# ðŸ‘‹ Jaime Here!

And yes, I did use my name as a greeting. */Hay.-meh/* :)

<span style="font-size: 28px;">Iâ€™m a data analyst who loves turning numbers into compelling narratives. Iâ€™m passionate about digging into data, uncovering insights, and visualizing them in ways that make a real impact. My Computer Science background and certifications in Google Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Data Science provide a strong foundation for my analytical work. Running a small manufacturing business has given me invaluable experience in leading teams and understanding the real-world impact of data-driven decisions</span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;">When I'm not wrestling with data (or spreadsheets), you'll probably find me gaming. I love the strategic thinking and data-driven decision-making that goes into even the most casual games or watching a movie/show, listening to podcasts</span>

<span style="font-size: 28px;">Let's connect!  You can find me on LinkedIn (links in the sidebar or the links page).  
Thanks for stopping by!



<span style="font-size: 56px;">Allons-y!!
