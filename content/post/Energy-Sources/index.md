## Project Purpose

This project charts the transformation of the global energy generation landscape from 1990 to 2020, revealing the rise of new energy sources and the decline of others.  The interactive dashboard allows users to explore when different energy sources emerged, how their contributions have changed, and gain a deeper understanding of the transition in energy production.

## Key Features & Insights:

*   **Interactive Time Exploration:**  A user-friendly time slider allows for dynamic exploration of energy usage trends year by year, from 1990 to 2020. This feature enables users to easily observe changes in energy consumption over time.
*   **Energy Source Breakdown:** The dashboard clearly visualizes energy consumption by source (e.g., coal, oil, gas, nuclear, renewables), allowing users to compare the contribution of different energy types and track the growth of renewable energy sources.


## Process

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Energy usage data was sourced from [data.gov.ph](https://data.gov.ph/index/public/dataset)
2.  **Dashboard Development (Power BI):** The interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI, incorporating visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, maps, and tables to effectively communicate the data insights.

## My Role & Contributions:

*   "Designed and implemented the data model in Power BI, optimizing it for performance and interactive exploration."
*   "Created the interactive visualizations in Power BI, effectively communicating key trends in Philippine energy."


## Tool Used:

Power BI

## Key Learnings:

This project provided a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of Power BI's capabilities.  I gained practical experience in data modeling, visualization design, and interactive dashboard development, solidifying my skills in these key areas.
